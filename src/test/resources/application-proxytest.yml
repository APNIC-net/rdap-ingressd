rdap:
    # A list of RDAP authorities may be configured ahead of time, if
    # required.  Each authority has a name, an optional list of
    # aliases, and a list of RDAP servers. RDAP servers are choosen from the
    # list based on first server found containing a https connection. If no
    # server is available with https then the first available http server is
    # choosen. Alternatively a defaultServer attribute can be specified giving
    # the URI of the default server to use.
